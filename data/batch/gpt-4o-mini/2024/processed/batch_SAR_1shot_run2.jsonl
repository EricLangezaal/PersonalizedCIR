{"sample_id": "14-10", "LLM_select": "[4]", "rewrite_utt_text": "Can you compare compact fluorescent lights and LED bulbs for growing indoor plants?", "response_utt_text": "Compact fluorescent lights (CFLs) are cost-effective and provide good light for growing indoor plants, especially in small spaces. They generate less heat compared to incandescent bulbs, making them safer for your plants. However, their lifespan is typically around 7,000 to 15,000 hours.\n\nOn the other hand, LED bulbs are more energy-efficient, often lasting 25,000 to 50,000 hours, which means they require fewer replacements. They emit less heat, which reduces the risk of overheating your plants, and they come in various spectrums, making them versatile for different growth stages.\n\nIn summary, while CFLs are budget-friendly and effective for growing plants, LEDs are a longer-lasting, energy-efficient option with superior flexibility in light spectrum. If you plan to grow a variety of plants, LEDs might be the better investment in the long run."}
