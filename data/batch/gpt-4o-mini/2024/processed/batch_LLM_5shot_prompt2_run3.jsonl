{"sample_id": "1-3", "rewrite_utt_text": "What is the reason behind using alcohol as the primary ingredient in most fragrances?", "response_utt_text": "Alcohol is commonly used in fragrances for several reasons. Firstly, it acts as a solvent, helping to dissolve the essential oils and aromatic compounds, which enables the formulation of a balanced and pleasant scent. Secondly, alcohol helps to disperse the fragrance evenly when sprayed, enhancing the diffusion of scent into the air. Additionally, alcohol evaporates quickly, which releases the fragrance notes and allows for a more immediate olfactory experience. This rapid evaporation also contributes to the scent's staying power on the skin, as the alcohol dries off and leaves behind the fragrance oils. Lastly, alcohol is relatively inexpensive and widely available, making it a popular choice for fragrance manufacturers.
