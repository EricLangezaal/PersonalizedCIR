Both have a high concentration of fragrance oils, typically between 15% to 40%, making them last longer than lighter scents like Eau de Toilette or Eau Fraiche. \n\nEau de Parfum is designed for general use and typically lasts about 4 to 8 hours on the skin, while Parfum offers an even more concentrated scent experience, lasting 8 to 24 hours or more. \n\nIn terms of scent profiles, EDPs often have a more complex scent with a rich blend of top, middle, and base notes that evolve over time. Parfums provide an intense fragrance right from the start, with a lingering base that enhances its depth. \n\nBoth types can feature various scent families, such as floral, woody, oriental, and fresh, allowing you to choose a fragrance that suits your personal taste and skin chemistry.

{"sample_id": "4-7-12", "rewrite_utt_text": "What are the social symptoms of depression, and how do they affect someone's daily life and relationships?", "response_utt_text": "The social symptoms of depression significantly impact a person's interactions and involvement in daily activities. Individuals may withdraw from friendships and avoid social situations they once enjoyed, leading to feelings of isolation. This withdrawal can manifest as neglecting to make plans or declining invitations, which can strain relationships and disrupt family dynamics. Moreover, lack of participation in social activities can exacerbate feelings of loneliness and sadness, creating a vicious cycle. People with depression may find it challenging to fulfill responsibilities at home, work, or in social circles, leading to increased stress and feelings of inadequacy. Communication can also suffer, as individuals may not express their feelings or struggles, further alienating themselves. These social symptoms highlight the importance of maintaining connections and engaging in supportive environments. Seeking help from friends, family, or professionals can be crucial for finding effective coping strategies and breaking the cycle of withdrawal.
