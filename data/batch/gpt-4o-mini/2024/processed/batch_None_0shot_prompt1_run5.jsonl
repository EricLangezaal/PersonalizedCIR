What are the benefits of minoxidil compared to finasteride?", "response_utt_text": "Minoxidil and finasteride are two commonly used medications for hair loss, each working in different ways. Minoxidil is a topical treatment applied directly to the scalp. It functions by dilating blood vessels and increasing blood flow to the hair follicles, which promotes hair growth and strengthens existing hair. Results can often be seen within a few months of consistent use. Finasteride, on the other hand, is an oral medication that reduces levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone that can shrink hair follicles and lead to hair loss. By inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to DHT, finasteride can help to slow or prevent further hair loss. Users typically see results in about three to six months, and it is taken daily.

While one-step cleansing involves using a single product to clean your face, it may not effectively remove all impurities, particularly if you wear makeup or sunscreen. Double cleansing, on the other hand, ensures that both oil-based and water-based impurities are removed, leading to cleaner and healthier skin.
