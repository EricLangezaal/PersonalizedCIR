{"sample_id": "1-3", "LLM_select": "[1, 10]", "rewrite_utt_text": "Why are most fragrances usually made of alcohol instead of oil or other bases?", "response_utt_text": "Most fragrances are made with alcohol because it acts as an excellent solvent that helps dissolve the fragrant oils while allowing the scent to evaporate quickly when applied, which enhances the overall fragrance experience. Alcohol-based perfumes tend to have a lighter feel and can be more easily sprayed, allowing for an even distribution of scent. Additionally, alcohol is a common preservative that helps improve the longevity of the fragrance, maintaining its freshness over time. While oil-based fragrances can last longer on the skin, they require a different application method and can sometimes leave stains on clothing.

Additionally, the base notes of a fragrance play a significant role; woody, spicy, and gourmand scents are typically more long-lasting than floral or citrus notes. The condition of your skin also matters; moisturizing your skin before applying fragrance can help lock in the scent, especially for those with sensitive skin. Environmental factors, such as temperature and humidity, can affect longevity as well, with warmer conditions enhancing diffusion and potentially leading to quicker evaporation. Finally, body heat can amplify the scent, so applying fragrance on pulse points can improve its longevity."}
