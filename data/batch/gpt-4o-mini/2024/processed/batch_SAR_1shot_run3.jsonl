These alternatives can be a better choice for individuals with sensitive skin or those who prefer to avoid alcohol-based products.

{"sample_id": "1-3", "LLM_select": "[]", "rewrite_utt_text": "Why are most fragrances made with alcohol?", "response_utt_text": "Fragrances are typically made with alcohol because it acts as a solvent that helps dissolve and blend the various aromatic compounds. Alcohol allows the scent to be more easily dispersed into the air, enhancing its projection and longevity when applied to the skin. Additionally, alcohol helps preserve the fragrance, preventing it from degrading over time, as it has antimicrobial properties. The evaporation of alcohol also contributes to the initial burst of fragrance you experience when applying it.

Secondly, the fragrance's composition matters\u2014base notes such as woods, resins, and musk provide a lasting foundation compared to lighter top notes like citrus and floral scents. Environmental factors, such as temperature and humidity, can affect how long a scent lasts on your skin; warmer temperatures can enhance sillage but also lead to faster evaporation. Additionally, the application method is essential; applying fragrance to pulse points (like wrists and neck) allows warmth to diffuse the scent effectively.
