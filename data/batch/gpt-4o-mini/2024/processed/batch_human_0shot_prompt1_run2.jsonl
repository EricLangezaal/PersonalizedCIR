Minoxidil is a topical treatment that acts as a vasodilator, enhancing blood flow to the scalp and providing hair follicles with more nutrients, which can help stimulate hair growth and strengthen existing hair. It's usually applied directly to the scalp twice a day. Finasteride, on the other hand, is an oral medication that inhibits the enzyme 5-alpha reductase, which converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Since DHT shrinks hair follicles and contributes to hair loss in men, reducing its levels can help slow hair loss and promote regrowth.

If you're looking for something soothing, try a serum with Centella Asiatica, which can calm inflammation and help with healing your skin.

Can Salicylic Acid be used with other treatments? What to do if my skin reacts to paired serums?", "response_utt_text": "Yes, you can use them together, but it's vital to introduce them gradually to avoid irritation. Start with one product, like Niacinamide or Salicylic Acid, and see how your skin reacts. If there is no irritation, you can slowly incorporate the other serums. Typically, it\u2019s recommended to apply lighter serums first, so you might use Niacinamide in the morning and Retinoids or Salicylic Acid in the evening.

For example, you could apply salicylic acid on one night and the retinol the next. This routine allows your skin to adjust to each ingredient while still reaping their benefits. Begin using retinol at a lower concentration to help your skin build tolerance, and consider applying it in the evening after cleansing and toning.

Choose a sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, as it provides adequate protection for daily use. For your oily, acne-prone skin, consider using a lightweight, oil-free, and non-comedogenic formula to prevent clogging pores. Mineral sunscreens with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide can be beneficial, as they\u2019re less irritating and provide a physical barrier against sun rays.

The oil-based cleanser will effectively remove your makeup and any oil-based impurities, while the water-based cleanser will help to cleanse your skin thoroughly without stripping away essential moisture. This method can help prevent your skin from feeling dry and can promote a more hydrated, healthy complexion. Just make sure to choose gentle, hydrating cleansers to protect your dry skin."}

While one-step cleansing may not thoroughly eliminate all traces of makeup and dirt, double cleansing ensures that both oil-based and water-based impurities are properly addressed. This method helps to prevent a buildup of residue on the skin, which can lead to dullness and irritation.

In the morning, you may not need a full double cleanse unless you have heavy residue from the night. A gentle, single water-based cleanse might suffice to remove any overnight oils and prepare your skin for makeup.

Should I use glycolic acid toner on dry skin?", "response_utt_text": "Glycolic acid toners can be effective for many skin types, but they may not be the best choice for you since you have dry skin. Glycolic acid is an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) that exfoliates the skin by removing dead skin cells. While this can help with texture and clarity, it can also lead to further dryness and irritation, especially if used frequently. Instead, consider using gentle, hydrating toners that contain ingredients like aloe vera, rose water, or glycerin to help maintain your skin's moisture levels. If you still want to try a glycolic acid toner, use it sparingly and follow up with a rich moisturizer to counteract any potential drying effects."}

It's best to apply them with a cotton pad, gently sweeping it over your skin while avoiding the eye area. It's recommended to use them in the evening, as glycolic acid can make your skin more sensitive to sunlight. Start by using the toner two to three times a week, then gradually increase the frequency as your skin adjusts.

Instead, you can apply hydrating toners directly to your palms and gently press them into your skin for maximum absorption.
