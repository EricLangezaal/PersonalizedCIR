Minoxidil is a topical solution that increases blood flow to the scalp, promoting nutrient delivery to hair follicles, which helps to stimulate hair growth. It can work for both men and women and is often an initial treatment choice. However, results can vary, and it may take several months to see noticeable improvements. On the other hand, finasteride is an oral medication that specifically targets the hormone DHT, which is linked to hair follicle miniaturization. By reducing DHT levels, finasteride can slow hair loss and promote regrowth in men, but it's not recommended for women. Side effects can occur with both treatments; hence, it's essential to discuss them with a healthcare professional to determine the best option for your needs."}

While finasteride works internally by blocking the hormone DHT, minoxidil acts topically to promote blood circulation to the hair follicles, enhancing growth.

Start with niacinamide, as it is gentle and can help soothe your skin and strengthen the barrier. Follow with hyaluronic acid for hydration. After those, you can apply retinoids (not every night initially, to prevent irritation) and salicylic acid, but consider using them at different times (like retinoids at night and salicylic acid in the morning) if you're concerned about over-exfoliation.

If your skin tolerates it well, you can move to using them on consecutive nights. Always apply retinol at night since it can make your skin more sensitive to the sun. Use a gentle cleanser, then apply your salicylic acid, wait for a few minutes (if using a leave-on product), and follow up with a lightweight moisturizer.

One-step cleansing might not fully eliminate heavier makeup, sunscreen, or pollutants, especially if you have dry skin that tends to retain products. As a result, sticking to just one cleanser could leave residues that may lead to further dryness or irritation.

Glycolic acid exfoliates the top layer of skin, which can help with texture and radiance. However, it can also lead to further dryness and irritation if your skin is already feeling parched. If you want to explore glycolic acid, start with a low concentration and monitor how your skin reacts.
