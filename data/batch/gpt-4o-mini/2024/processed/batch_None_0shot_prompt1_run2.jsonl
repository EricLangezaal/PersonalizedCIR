Alcohol acts as a carrier, quickly evaporating when sprayed, leaving behind the fragrance on the skin or fabric.

Higher concentrations of scented oils in Eau De Parfum and Parfum tend to last longer on the skin. Additionally, the presence of base notes like woods, resins, and musks can enhance lasting power, as they evaporate slowly.

Glycolic acid is an alpha-hydroxy acid (AHA) known for its exfoliating properties, which can help with dullness and uneven texture. However, it can also be drying and irritating, especially if used too frequently. If you're interested in trying a glycolic acid toner, I recommend starting with a lower concentration and using it sparingly, such as once or twice a week, while monitoring how your skin reacts.

Hardtail mountain bikes have a solid rear end and front suspension, which makes them lighter and more efficient on smoother trails. They are great for climbing and have less maintenance due to fewer moving parts. Full-suspension mountain bikes, on the other hand, feature both front and rear suspension.
