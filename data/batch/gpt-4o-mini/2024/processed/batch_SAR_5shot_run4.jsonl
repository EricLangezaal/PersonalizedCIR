Firstly, the concentration of the fragrance plays a significant role; higher concentrations like Parfum and Eau De Parfum contain more scented oils and typically last longer than lighter formulations like Eau De Toilette. Additionally, the type of fragrance notes matters; base notes such as woods, resins, and ambers linger longer than lighter top notes like citrus or fruits. \n\nMoreover, skin chemistry also affects fragrance longevity; dry skin tends to hold scents less effectively than oily skin, so moisturizing before applying fragrance can help it last longer. Environmental factors, such as temperature and humidity, can also impact how a scent dissipates. Finally, applying fragrance to pulse points, where blood vessels are closer to the skin, can enhance its staying power. Remember that sensitive skin might react differently, so a patch test on the inner wrist is a good idea to prevent irritation."}

On the other hand, depression is a more persistent state that may not be linked to a specific loss and typically involves pervasive feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, and a lack of interest in life that lasts longer and can interfere significantly with daily functioning. While grief can eventually lead to acceptance and healing, depression may require clinical intervention.

{"sample_id": "14-8", "LLM_select": "[11, 9]", "rewrite_utt_text": "Do you have any advice on how to grow vegetables indoors in my cubby hole?", "response_utt_text": "Growing vegetables indoors can be rewarding! First, ensure you have suitable containers with drainage holes. Use high-quality potting mix and consider adding a diluted liquid fertilizer every few weeks. Since you mentioned having low light, opt for fast-growing crops that can tolerate it, like leafy greens (e.g., lettuce and spinach), which prefer indirect sunlight. For additional light, you might want to invest in grow lights to enhance growth, especially during shorter days. Water the plants regularly but be careful not to overwater; check the top inch of soil for dryness before watering again. Starting with easy options, like microgreens or salad greens, can help you gain confidence. Each vegetable has its unique requirements, so check for light, water, and temperature needs. Would you like more specific advice for a particular vegetable?"}
{"sample_id": "14-9", "LLM_select": "[1, 6, 11]", "rewrite_utt_text": "Yes, can you suggest some grow lights for my plants in my cubby hole?", "response_utt_text": "There are several good options for grow lights that can help your indoor plants thrive. LED grow lights are popular due to their energy efficiency and long lifespan. They emit very little heat, which is ideal for small spaces like your cubby hole. Consider full-spectrum LED grow lights, which provide a balanced light spectrum and are effective for all stages of plant growth. Alternatively, fluorescent grow lights are also suitable, with T5 fluorescent tubes being a great choice for smaller setups. They are easy to install and relatively inexpensive. When looking for grow lights, ensure they have adjustable heights for flexibility as your plants grow and check that they are suitable for the height of your cubby hole. Start with a light that provides around 12-16 hours of illumination daily, adjusting as needed based on your plants\u2019 responses.

{"sample_id": "14-10", "LLM_select": "[3, 4]", "rewrite_utt_text": "Can you compare Compact Fluorescent Lights and LED Bulbs for growing indoor plants?", "response_utt_text": "Compact Fluorescent Lights (CFLs) and LED Bulbs are both effective options for indoor plant growth, but they differ in several ways. CFLs are generally less expensive upfront and provide a broader spectrum of light, including both blue and red wavelengths, which are beneficial for plant growth. However, they can produce more heat and have a shorter lifespan, typically lasting around 8,000 hours. \n\nOn the other hand, LED Bulbs are more energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan, often lasting up to 25,000 hours or more. They emit less heat, reducing the risk of overheating your plants. Although LED lights can have a higher initial cost, they save money on electricity and replacement bulbs over time. If you're looking for a low-maintenance and efficient option, LEDs might be the better choice for your cubby hole."}
