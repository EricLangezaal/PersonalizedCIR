People often believe that pulling hair back tightly in hairstyles like ponytails will lead to hair loss, but while traction alopecia can occur in extreme cases, it typically requires years of consistent tight styling.

Minoxidil is a topical treatment applied directly to the scalp; it stimulates hair follicles by increasing blood flow and nutrient supply, promoting hair growth. It works for various types of hair loss and can be used by both men and women. Finasteride, on the other hand, is an oral medication that reduces levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone linked to male pattern baldness. By lowering DHT levels, finasteride helps prevent hair follicles from shrinking, thus slowing hair loss and promoting regrowth. While minoxidil starts working relatively quickly, it may require continuous use for effects to be visible, whereas finasteride might take a few months to show results.
