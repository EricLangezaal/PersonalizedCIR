On the other hand, Finasteride targets hormone levels by inhibiting the conversion of testosterone to DHT, a hormone linked to hair loss. It is usually taken as a daily pill and can prevent further hair loss while promoting regrowth in some users.

However, it's essential to proceed with caution. Glycolic acid is an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) that helps exfoliate the skin by removing dead skin cells, promoting cell turnover, and enhancing radiance. For dry skin, it\u2019s crucial to choose a toner that includes hydrating ingredients, like hyaluronic acid or aloe vera, to mitigate potential dryness that glycolic acid can cause.
