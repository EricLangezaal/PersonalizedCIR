Additionally, the base notes\u2014usually heavier and richer ingredients\u2014tend to linger longer on the skin. The application method matters too; applying fragrance directly to pulse points can enhance its wear.

Minoxidil is applied topically and acts as a vasodilator, increasing blood flow to the scalp and providing essential nutrients to hair follicles, which helps to strengthen them and promote hair regrowth. It is generally suitable for both men and women and can be effective for a broad range of hair types.\n\nOn the other hand, finasteride is an oral medication that specifically targets the hormone DHT (dihydrotestosterone), which can shrink hair follicles and contribute to hair loss in men. By reducing DHT levels, finasteride can slow hair loss and encourage regrowth. However, it is typically prescribed for men only due to potential side effects.

Glycolic acid is an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) that helps exfoliate the skin, promoting a smoother appearance and aiding in moisture retention. However, it can potentially cause irritation or dryness if overused, especially for those with sensitive or dry skin. If you decide to try glycolic acid, start with a lower concentration and use it intermittently, perhaps a few times a week, rather than daily.
