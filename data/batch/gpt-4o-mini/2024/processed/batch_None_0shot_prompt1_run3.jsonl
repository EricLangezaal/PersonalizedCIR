It's applied directly to the scalp, and users often experience results within several months, although the effects can vary. On the other hand, finasteride is an oral medication that works by reducing the levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone linked to hair loss. By lowering DHT levels, finasteride can help slow hair loss and stimulate regrowth. Users typically see results after a few months, but it may take longer for optimal effects to be visible.

An SPF of 30 or higher is recommended for daily use. For oily or acne-prone skin, opt for a lightweight, non-comedogenic sunscreen to prevent clogging pores. Mineral sunscreens with zinc oxide or titanium dioxide are great options as they are less likely to irritate the skin. If you're active or plan to be outdoors, consider a water-resistant formula.

UVA rays penetrate deeply and are primarily responsible for causing long-term skin damage, such as premature aging and skin cancer. They can lead to wrinkles, pigmentation changes, and DNA damage in skin cells. On the other hand, UVB rays are known for causing sunburn and direct damage to the skin's surface. While UVB rays can also contribute to skin cancer, the deep penetration of UVA rays makes them particularly concerning for long-term skin health.

It is beneficial for all skin types, including oily, dry, and combination skin. However, if you have very sensitive skin or conditions like eczema or rosacea, you may want to proceed with caution and consult a dermatologist.

One-step cleansing may not completely remove all impurities, especially makeup and sunscreen, leading to residue that can clog pores and cause breakouts. With double cleansing, the oil-based cleanser breaks down heavy products, and the water-based cleanser then eliminates any remaining residue, leaving your skin thoroughly clean and fresh.

Many people choose to use a lighter, single-step cleansing or simply rinse their face in the morning. In the evening, however, double cleansing can be beneficial to thoroughly clean away any makeup, oil, and impurities accumulated throughout the day.

However, since you have dry skin, it's important to approach glycolic acid with caution. While it can help exfoliate and promote cell turnover, it may also lead to increased dryness and irritation if used too frequently or in high concentrations.

Hardtail mountain bikes have a solid rear (no rear suspension) and a front suspension fork, making them lighter and more efficient on smooth trails. They offer better pedaling efficiency and are generally more affordable, which is great for beginners or those who primarily ride on less technical terrains. On the other hand, full-suspension mountain bikes have both front and rear suspension, providing more comfort and control on rough terrains by absorbing bumps and shocks.
