Traditional fragrances, such as Eau Fraiche and Eau De Parfum, typically contain varying amounts of alcohol to help disperse the scent through the air and enhance its longevity. Alcohol acts as a solvent for the aromatic compounds. However, if you have sensitive skin or prefer to avoid alcohol for any reason, you can opt for oil-based perfumes or solid perfumes, which primarily contain oils and waxes instead of alcohol. These alcohol-free options can be gentler on sensitive skin and still provide a pleasant fragrance experience. If you want to explore further, consider looking for brands that specialize in natural or organic fragrances, as they often offer alcohol-free alternatives."}
{"sample_id": "1-3", "LLM_select": "1, 5, 10", "rewrite_utt_text": "Why are fragrances commonly formulated with alcohol as a primary ingredient?", "response_utt_text": "Fragrances are typically made with alcohol because it acts as an effective solvent that helps to dissolve and blend the essential oils and fragrance compounds. Alcohol also aids in the diffusion of the scent, allowing it to evaporate quickly and disperse more readily into the air, making the fragrance more noticeable. Additionally, alcohol has preservation properties, extending the shelf life of the perfume by preventing the growth of bacteria and mold. While some oil-based fragrances exist, they tend to deliver a more prolonged scent but may not disperse as broadly as alcohol-based ones. Keep in mind that for individuals with sensitive skin, like yourself, opt for alcohol-free formulations to reduce irritation and skin reactions."}
{"sample_id": "1-4", "LLM_select": "1, 8, 9", "rewrite_utt_text": "What factors contribute to the longevity of a fragrance on the skin?", "response_utt_text": "The longevity of a fragrance is influenced by several factors. First, the concentration of perfume oils directly affects lasting power; higher concentrations, such as Parfum, typically last longer than lighter formulations like Eau de Toilette. Skin type also plays a role; oilier skin tends to hold fragrances longer than dry skin, which can absorb scents more quickly. Environmental conditions, like humidity and temperature, can impact how long a fragrance lingers; warmer temps often intensify scents initially but may cause quicker evaporation. Additionally, the application method matters\u2014placing perfume on pulse points for warmth enhances diffusion, potentially extending its presence. Finally, the fragrance's composition itself, with certain notes like base notes (woody, musky) generally lasting longer than top notes (citrusy, fresh), can affect how long the scent remains detectable."}

Parfum, the most concentrated and saturated type, contains 20-30% fragrance oil, providing an intense scent lasting up to 24 hours. Additionally, oil-based perfumes tend to last even longer than alcohol-based fragrances, as they don't evaporate as quickly. Their composition might include floral, fruity, or gourmand notes, which can evoke different feelings and experiences.
