Secondly, the type of fragrance base can impact longevity. Notes such as woods, resins, and ambers tend to last longer than lighter top notes like citrus or florals. Additionally, the way you apply the fragrance matters; applying it to pulse points (like your wrists and neck) can enhance its staying power.

On the other hand, finasteride is an oral medication that targets the hormonal aspect of hair loss by reducing levels of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone linked to hair follicle shrinkage. Finasteride can be particularly effective for male pattern baldness but does come with potential side effects, such as decreased libido or erectile dysfunction in some users.
