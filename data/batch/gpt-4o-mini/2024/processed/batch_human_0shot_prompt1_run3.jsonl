Start with cleansing your face, then apply niacinamide serum, followed by hyaluronic acid for hydration. After these two serums have absorbed, you can apply the retinoid. However, because retinoids can be potent, you may want to start using them a few times a week and gradually increase frequency as your skin builds tolerance.

Since you have oily, acne-prone skin, opt for a lightweight, oil-free, or gel-based sunscreen to avoid clogging pores. Ingredients such as zinc oxide or titanium dioxide are often recommended for sensitive and acne-prone skin, as they provide physical protection without irritation. Additionally, consider a sunscreen that contains added beneficial ingredients, like niacinamide, as it can help control excess oil and provide extra hydration to your skin.

How does UVA radiation contribute to skin aging?", "response_utt_text": "UVA radiation can penetrate deep into the skin, leading to long-term damage such as premature aging, wrinkles, and an increased risk of skin cancer. This type of radiation can cause changes at the cellular level, contributing to the breakdown of collagen and elastin, essential proteins that keep the skin firm and youthful. Unlike UVB rays, which primarily affect the skin's surface, UVA rays can also harm the skin even on cloudy days or through windows.

How does double cleansing affect dry skin? Is double cleansing necessary for makeup wearers?", "response_utt_text": "Yes, double cleansing is suitable for you, especially since you wear makeup regularly. The oil-based cleanser will effectively remove makeup and other oil-based impurities, while the water-based cleanser will ensure your skin is thoroughly clean without stripping moisture. This method can help prevent dry skin by maintaining your skin's natural barrier, as it allows for effective cleansing without the harsh effects of a single, stripping cleanser.

What advantages does double cleansing have for dry skin? Is one-step cleansing sufficient for makeup wearers?", "response_utt_text": "Compared to one-step cleansing, double cleansing offers a more thorough approach to removing makeup and impurities. One-step cleansing may not effectively remove all oil-based products, which can leave residue on your skin, especially if you wear makeup regularly. In contrast, double cleansing ensures that your skin is completely clean, as the first oil-based cleanser breaks down makeup and sunscreen, while the second water-based cleanser removes any residual impurities. This method can also prevent dryness and irritation by allowing your skin to retain moisture, making it a better option for those with dry skin."}

In the morning, a gentle cleanse can help remove any overnight buildup without being harsh on your skin. In the evening, the double cleansing method effectively removes makeup and impurities, ensuring a clean canvas for your nighttime skincare.

Should I avoid glycolic acid if my skin is dry? What toners are better for dry skin than glycolic acid?", "response_utt_text": "Glycolic acid toner is generally not recommended for dry skin as it can be overly exfoliating and may strip natural moisture, leading to increased dryness and irritation. Instead, consider using toners that are hydrating and soothing, containing ingredients like hyaluronic acid, rose water, or glycerin, which can help maintain moisture levels and support your skin's barrier. If you do wish to incorporate glycolic acid in your routine, it may be best to use it very sparingly and follow up with a good moisturizer to mitigate any potential drying effects."}

How often should I use glycolic acid toner? What to do if glycolic acid toner irritates my skin?", "response_utt_text": "Glycolic acid toners should be used after cleansing your face. Start by applying a small amount (around a dime-sized portion) on a cotton pad and gently swipe it over your skin, avoiding the eye area. It's best to use them in your nighttime routine, allowing your skin to adjust gradually. Start with using it 1-2 times a week and monitor how your skin reacts. If your skin tolerates it well, you can gradually increase to every other night. Always follow up with a good moisturizer to help prevent further dryness, and remember to apply sunscreen daily, as glycolic acid can increase your skin's sensitivity to the sun.

These toners can help soothe and hydrate your dry skin without the potential irritation that glycolic acid may cause.

If you prefer, you can apply hydrating toners directly with your hands by gently pressing the toner into your skin. This method can be more efficient since it reduces product waste.
