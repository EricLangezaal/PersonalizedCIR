By decreasing DHT levels, finasteride can slow hair loss and promote regrowth; however, it is generally prescribed only for men. While minoxidil might have a more immediate effect in the short term, finasteride addresses the hormonal aspects of hair loss for more sustained results.

It's important to apply them in this order: after cleansing and toning your skin, apply the Niacinamide serum first, as it helps with inflammation and barrier function. Next, layer the Hyaluronic acid serum to ensure your skin stays hydrated. Finally, apply the Retinoid product. If you're new to retinoids, start with a lower concentration and gradually increase usage to let your skin adjust.

For example, you could use salicylic acid on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday nights, and retinol on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. This routine allows your skin to benefit from both ingredients while preventing excessive dryness or irritation. On the remaining night (Sunday), you might want to use a gentle moisturizer or a soothing hydrating treatment to give your skin a break.

UVB rays are primarily responsible for sunburn and can contribute to skin cancer, while UVA rays penetrate the skin more deeply and are linked to premature aging and skin damage. Using a broad-spectrum sunscreen ensures you are protected from both types of harmful UV radiation, which is essential for maintaining healthy skin and reducing the risk of skin-related issues, especially when you're dealing with acne-prone and sensitive skin.

As a general rule, about 1 pound of sulfur per 100 square feet can effectively lower the pH by approximately 0.5. Be sure to mix it thoroughly into the top 6 inches of soil and water it well. Alternatively, some organic materials like peat moss or pine needles can help, but they work more slowly. Always test the pH again after a few months to check your progress. If you need more detailed steps or recommendations on applying these materials, feel free to ask!"}
