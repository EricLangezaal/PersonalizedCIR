The main types of fragrances, including Eau Fraiche, Eau De Toilette, Eau De Cologne, Eau De Parfum, and Parfum, all contain a significant amount of alcohol, but they also differ in the concentration of essential oils. For instance, Eau Fraiche and Eau De Cologne typically have a lower concentration of scented oils (around 1-5%) compared to Eau De Toilette (5-15%), Eau De Parfum (15-20%), and Parfum (20-40%). The higher the concentration of scented oils, the less alcohol is present relative to the fragrance compound.

{"sample_id": "1-3", "LLM_select": "1, 7, 8", "rewrite_utt_text": "Why are most fragrances typically formulated with alcohol as a primary ingredient?", "response_utt_text": "Most fragrances are formulated with alcohol because it acts as an effective solvent that helps to dissolve the aromatic compounds. Alcohol also evaporates quickly when applied to the skin, allowing the fragrance to release its scent more effectively. Additionally, alcohol-based perfumes tend to have a lighter feel and initially project a stronger aroma, which can enhance the overall scent experience. \n\nMoreover, using alcohol allows for a longer shelf life, as it inhibits the growth of bacteria and preserves the scent. However, it's worth noting that while alcohol is common, there are also oil-based fragrances that are alcohol-free, which can be a better option for individuals with sensitive skin or those looking for a longer-lasting scent without the potential irritation that alcohol may cause. If you're interested in exploring alternatives, many brands now offer a range of options catering to various preferences."}

Firstly, the concentration of fragrance oils plays a crucial role; for example, Parfum has a higher concentration than Eau de Toilette, making it last longer. Additionally, the scent's base notes, such as woods or resins, typically have greater staying power than lighter top notes like citrus. \n\nFor individuals with sensitive skin, oil-based fragrances can be a good choice as they often last longer than alcohol-based ones and are less likely to irritate the skin. The type of application can also affect longevity; applying fragrance on pulse points, where the skin is warmer, can enhance diffusion and lasting power.\n\nFinally, environmental conditions and the individual's skin chemistry\u2014like hydration levels and pH\u2014can change how long a fragrance lasts. Choosing products with natural ingredients may also align with your preference for scents that are gentler on the skin."}
