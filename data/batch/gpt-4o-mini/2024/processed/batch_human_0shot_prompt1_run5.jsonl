Minoxidil is a topical solution that enhances blood circulation in the scalp, which helps to nourish hair follicles, encouraging hair regrowth. It's usually applied directly to the scalp and can be effective for both men and women. On the other hand, Finasteride is an oral medication that targets a hormonal cause of hair loss. By inhibiting the enzyme that converts testosterone to DHT (dihydrotestosterone), it reduces DHT levels in the body, which can help prevent hair follicles from shrinking and ultimately lead to hair regrowth. While Minoxidil may require consistent application, Finasteride usually needs to be taken daily to maintain results. Side effects can vary; Minoxidil may cause scalp irritation, while Finasteride may lead to sexual side effects.

Since you have oily, acne-prone skin, opt for a lightweight, oil-free, and non-comedogenic formula to prevent clogging your pores. Ingredients like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide are good options, as they are less irritating and work well for sensitive skin. Consider mineral-based sunscreens, as they sit on top of the skin and reflect UV rays rather than absorb them. Additionally, ensure that it is water-resistant if you plan to sweat or be in the water.

It's best to use it at night to minimize the potential for irritation from sun exposure. If you're new to glycolic acid, start by using it 1-2 times a week and gradually increase frequency as your skin gets accustomed.

Hardtail mountain bikes have a solid rear end and a front suspension. They are typically lighter, more affordable, and offer better power transfer, making them great for climbing and less technical trails. Full-suspension mountain bikes, on the other hand, feature both front and rear suspension systems, which provide more comfort and traction on rough terrains by absorbing shocks from bumps and obstacles.
