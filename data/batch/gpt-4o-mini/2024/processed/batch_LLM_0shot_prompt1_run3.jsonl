Look for fragrances that are labeled as hypoallergenic or specifically designed for sensitive skin. Generally, lighter scents such as citrus, floral, or herbal notes can be more suitable, while fragrances with heavy musk or synthetic ingredients might cause irritation. Additionally, testing fragrances on a small patch of skin before fully applying can help avoid any allergic reactions.

How to incorporate a serum into my skincare routine?", "response_utt_text": "For the evening routine, the third step involves incorporating a treatment serum. Look for serums that focus on acne control, such as those containing ingredients like salicylic acid, niacinamide, or tea tree oil, as they help to reduce breakouts and inflammation. These ingredients effectively penetrate the skin without clogging pores. Additionally, consider serums with hyaluronic acid to boost hydration and combat dehydration, which is particularly important for oily skin that lacks moisture.

This approach allows your skin to adjust to the ingredients while benefiting from both. Always remember to follow up with a good moisturizer after applying these treatments to counteract any dryness.

Ingredients like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide are ideal, as they offer physical sun protection and are generally less irritating. Additionally, consider sunscreens that contain niacinamide, as this can help regulate sebum production and soothe inflammation.

Therefore, while both types of radiation are dangerous, the effects of UVA exposure often accumulate over time, leading to more serious issues.

One-step cleansing may not adequately cleanse the skin of all makeup, sunscreen, and pollution, particularly for those with heavier makeup or environmental exposure. This can lead to buildup, which may further exacerbate dryness and irritation.
