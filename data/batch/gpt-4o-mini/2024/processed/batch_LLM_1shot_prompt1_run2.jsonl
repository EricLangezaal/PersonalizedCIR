Minoxidil is a topical solution applied directly to the scalp. It acts as a vasodilator, increasing blood flow to hair follicles, thereby delivering essential nutrients and promoting hair growth. Users typically notice improvements in hair density and regrowth within a few months of consistent use. On the other hand, Finasteride is an oral medication that reduces the level of dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone linked to hair follicle shrinking in men. By lowering DHT levels, Finasteride helps maintain hair density and slows further loss. Many users experience positive results after six months to a year. While both treatments can be effective, Minoxidil may have a faster visible effect, while Finasteride works through hormonal regulation for longer-term benefits.

Look for broad-spectrum sunscreens with at least SPF 30 to shield against UVA and UVB rays. Choose an oil-free, non-comedogenic formula to avoid clogging your pores. Gel-based or mattifying sunscreens work well for oily skin types as they provide hydration without adding extra oil. Look for ingredients like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide for physical sun protection, as they are generally gentler on the skin. You can also consider sunscreens that contain additional skin-friendly ingredients, such as niacinamide, which can help with oil control and redness.

This method effectively removes makeup and other impurities, which is crucial for maintaining healthy skin, particularly if you have dry skin. However, it's important to choose gentle cleansers that won't strip moisture from your skin.

One-step cleansing usually involves a single product, which may not effectively remove all impurities, especially if you're using makeup or sunscreen. With double cleansing, the oil-based cleanser first lifts away heavier, oil-based impurities, while the water-based cleanser ensures that any remaining residue is gently washed away. This process not only cleans the skin more effectively but also prepares it for subsequent skincare products, allowing them to penetrate better.

In the morning, a gentle water-based cleanser might be sufficient to refresh your skin without stripping moisture. In the evening, however, double cleansing becomes more important to effectively remove makeup and impurities.

Glycolic acid is an exfoliating agent that can help with skin texture and brightness, but it can also strip moisture from your skin, potentially exacerbating dryness and irritation. Instead, look for hydrating toners that contain ingredients like hyaluronic acid or rose water, which can help maintain moisture levels while providing gentle exfoliation without drying out your skin.

Lactic acid is a milder AHA that helps improve skin texture without being overly harsh. A hydrating toner will help replenish moisture and can contain ingredients like glycerin or aloe vera, which soothe and hydrate the skin.
