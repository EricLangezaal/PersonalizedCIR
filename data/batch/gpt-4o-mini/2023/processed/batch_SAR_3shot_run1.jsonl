Why do I need them?", "response_utt_text": "Waist circumference (WC) measures the distance around your waist and helps assess the distribution of body fat. A higher WC is associated with greater risk of obesity-related conditions such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes, especially when the measurement exceeds certain thresholds (generally 40 inches for men and 35 inches for women).\n\nThe waist-hip ratio (WHR) compares the circumference of your waist to that of your hips. It provides insight into body fat distribution and predicts health risks related to obesity. A WHR above 0.90 for men and 0.85 for women indicates an increased risk of metabolic and cardiovascular issues.\n\nBoth WC and WHR can be better indicators of health risks than BMI alone, as they account for fat distribution rather than just weight. This is particularly useful if you're concerned about how your weight impacts your health, especially with your knee injury."}
