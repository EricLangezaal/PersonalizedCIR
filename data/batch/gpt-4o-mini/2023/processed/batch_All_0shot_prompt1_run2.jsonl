Steaming involves cooking food over boiling water, which helps retain more nutrients and moisture in the ingredients while using no added fat. This method is particularly beneficial for vegetables and proteins, ensuring they stay tender without altering their nutritional value. Grilling, on the other hand, involves cooking food over direct heat, which can enhance flavors and create a nice char. It allows excess fat to drip away, making it a healthier option for meats.

Distilled spirits, like base liquors and liqueurs, undergo distillation, which involves heating fermented alcohol to separate the alcohol from the water, resulting in a higher alcohol content. Undistilled spirits, such as wine and beer, are produced through fermentation alone, retaining lower alcohol levels and more of their natural flavors. Each type offers a unique taste and experience based on the ingredients and methods used.

However, they differ significantly in composition and use; liquors are more concentrated forms of alcohol, while liqueurs are typically sweeter and flavored, making them distinct in culinary and beverage contexts.
