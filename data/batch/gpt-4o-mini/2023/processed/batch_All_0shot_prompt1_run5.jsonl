Strength training generally focuses on lifting heavier weights with lower repetitions, targeting specific muscle groups for hypertrophy and strength. It\u2019s typically done with a set rest time between sets. In contrast, HIIT combines short bursts of high-intensity exercises with brief recovery periods, promoting both muscle gain and fat loss. HIIT workouts can elevate heart rate and improve cardiovascular fitness while still providing muscle engagement through various bodyweight or weighted exercises. While strength training is crucial for maximizing muscle size and strength over time, HIIT adds a dynamic element that can lead to increased metabolic rate and calorie burn, making it effective for those looking to build muscle while also improving their overall fitness. Many fitness enthusiasts often incorporate both methods to achieve balanced results and prevent workout monotony."}
