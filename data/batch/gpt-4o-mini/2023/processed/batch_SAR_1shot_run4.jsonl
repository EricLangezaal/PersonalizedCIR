{"sample_id": "21-1-3", "LLM_select": "[4]", "rewrite_utt_text": "How can countries strengthen their health systems to effectively prepare for future pandemics, especially considering the challenges faced by poorer nations?", "response_utt_text": "Strengthening health systems in poorer nations requires international cooperation and substantial investment. These countries often face significant barriers, including limited healthcare infrastructure, insufficient health workforce, and inadequate funding. To address these inequalities, initiatives like the Global Health Security Agenda advocate for enhanced local capacities in disease prevention, detection, and response. Additionally, partnerships with organizations such as the World Health Organization can provide technical assistance and resources. It's crucial to promote sustainable health financing models, ensuring that essential health services are accessible to all, especially the marginalized populations. Moreover, equitable distribution of vaccines and treatments must be prioritized, involving community engagement to build trust and foster health literacy. Strengthening global supply chains and manufacturing capabilities in lower-income countries can help facilitate timely responses to health crises, ultimately leading to a fortified foundation for pandemic preparedness."}
