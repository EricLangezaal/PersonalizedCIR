This stringent limit encourages the body to enter a state of ketosis, where it burns fat for fuel instead of carbohydrates. \n\nOn the other hand, Atkins 40 provides a more gradual and flexible approach, permitting approximately 40 grams of net carbohydrates daily. This variation may be more suitable for individuals who prefer a less restrictive diet and want to lose weight steadily over a longer period. As you progress through the phases of either diet, both plans allow the introduction of different food groups, but Atkins 40 allows a broader range of carbohydrates.
