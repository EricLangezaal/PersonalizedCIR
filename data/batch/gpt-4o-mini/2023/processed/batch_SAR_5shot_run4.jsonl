{"sample_id": "20-2-14", "LLM_select": "[8]", "rewrite_utt_text": "Do histamine levels in foods change with cooking or processing methods?", "response_utt_text": "Yes, histamine levels in foods can be affected by cooking and processing methods. Cooking can reduce histamine levels by killing bacteria that produce histamine in certain foods. For instance, heating low-histamine foods can help reduce their histamine content. However, high-histamine foods, such as aged or fermented products, may not see a significant reduction in histamine levels with cooking. Additionally, improper food storage, like leaving cooked dishes at room temperature for extended periods, can increase histamine levels due to bacterial proliferation. Therefore, it\u2019s essential to manage both the cooking methods and food storage practices to help minimize histamine levels in your meals."}
