While cooking does not significantly reduce histamine levels in already high-histamine foods, certain methods can help mitigate histamine production. For example, fresh foods generally have lower histamine levels, whereas fermented and aged foods contain higher amounts of histamine. Cooking can denature histamines in some cases, but not eliminate them entirely. Additionally, food storage plays a significant role\u2014prolonged storage can increase histamine levels in certain foods. Cooking methods like boiling or steaming can reduce the levels of histamine in some rich histamine foods. Conversely, leaving cooked foods at room temperature for extended periods can lead to increased histamine production due to bacterial growth. Therefore, it is advisable to consume fresh foods and pay attention to proper storage practices to manage histamine intake effectively."}
