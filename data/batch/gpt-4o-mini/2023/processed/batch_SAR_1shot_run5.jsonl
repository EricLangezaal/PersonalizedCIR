The fermentation process converts sugars present in the fruit into alcohol, without distillation. Additionally, wines can vary widely in flavor profiles, depending on the grape type, region, and fermentation methods.\n\nBase liquors are often used as a foundation for cocktails, while wines are typically enjoyed on their own or paired with food.

Whiskey is made from fermented grain mash, resulting in varied flavors ranging from sweet and vanilla to smoky. Rum is made from sugarcane derivatives, delivering a sweet flavor, while tequila is derived from the blue agave plant, offering herbal and earthy notes. \n\nIn contrast, wine is made from fermented grapes, and its flavor can greatly vary depending on the grape variety, region, and wine-making process. For instance, red wines often have flavors like cherry and blackberry, while white wines can present citrus or floral notes. Wine typically has a lower alcohol content and a more complex flavor profile due to the natural sugars and tannins present in grapes.
