Liqueurs are sweetened spirits that can contain flavors from fruits, herbs, or spices, and usually have a lower alcohol content, around 15% to 30% ABV.\n\nOn the other hand, undistilled spirits, which encompass wine and beer, undergo fermentation but do not involve distillation. Wine is made from fermented grapes or other fruits, typically ranging from 8% to 15% ABV, while beer is brewed from barley, hops, and water, generally containing 3% to 12% ABV.
