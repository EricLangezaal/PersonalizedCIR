Firstly, investing in robust healthcare infrastructure is essential, ensuring that hospitals are well-equipped and staff trained to handle surges in patients. Secondly, improving surveillance systems for early detection of outbreaks can lead to quicker responses. This includes investing in technology for tracking potential zoonotic diseases and leveraging data analytics.\n\nAdditionally, countries can enhance public health messaging and education to prepare communities for preventive measures and promote vaccine uptake. Intergovernmental collaboration is also crucial; countries can work together, sharing data and resources, to coordinate responses to health threats. \n\nFurthermore, research and development for vaccines and treatments should be incentivized to ensure rapid availability during crises.
