Wines generally have a lower alcohol content, typically ranging from 8% to 15% ABV.

{"sample_id": "21-1-2", "LLM_select": "[1, 4, 10]", "rewrite_utt_text": "How can countries strengthen their response to pandemics and prepare for future health threats?", "response_utt_text": "Countries can strengthen their pandemic response by enhancing surveillance systems for early detection of outbreaks, investing in public health infrastructure, and improving laboratory capabilities. Building strong healthcare systems that can quickly mobilize resources in a crisis is crucial. Training healthcare workers and volunteers, like firefighters who may assist in emergency situations, ensures a well-prepared response team. Additionally, public education campaigns can inform communities about health threats and prevention strategies. Collaborative efforts with international organizations for knowledge sharing and research initiatives are also key, allowing for a more coordinated global approach to potential health crises. Engaging in simulations and drills can further test and improve readiness for future pandemics."}
{"sample_id": "21-1-3", "LLM_select": "[4, 8]", "rewrite_utt_text": "What measures are being taken to ensure that poorer countries are prepared for future pandemics, considering the unequal health system capabilities across the world?", "response_utt_text": "Many global health organizations emphasize the importance of equitable access to healthcare in poorer countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) and other international bodies advocate for increased investment in healthcare infrastructure, workforce training, and the distribution of medical supplies and funding to support the health systems in low-income nations. Initiatives like the COVAX Facility aim to deliver vaccines to low and middle-income countries to ensure they are not left behind in pandemic responses. Additionally, countries are encouraged to foster partnerships and technology transfers with developed nations to enhance capability development in public health preparedness. This approach emphasizes building resilient health systems capable of managing not only pandemics but also routine health challenges, striving for a balanced health landscape globally."}
