Examples include base liquors like vodka, whiskey, gin, tequila, rum, and liqueurs. These beverages typically have higher alcohol content, usually ranging from 20% to 50% alcohol by volume (ABV) or more. \n\nOn the other hand, undistilled spirits, also known as fermented alcohol, are beverages produced through fermentation without the distillation process. This category includes wine and beer, which are typically lower in alcohol content, generally ranging from 4% to 15% ABV for wines and up to 10% to 15% for most beers. The flavors and aromas in these beverages come from the ingredients used, such as grapes in wine or grains in beer, and they tend to have a more natural and varied taste profile compared to distilled spirits."}

Base liquors are often used as the foundation in cocktails, providing the main flavor and strength.  \n\nIn contrast, wine is an undistilled alcoholic beverage made through the fermentation of grapes or other fruits. The alcohol content usually ranges from 8% to 15% by volume. Wines are commonly enjoyed on their own or paired with food, highlighting flavors in culinary dishes, like pasta or salmon. While both base liquors and wines can enhance social experiences, they serve different roles in both cocktails and dining."}
{"sample_id": "16-1-5", "LLM_select": "1, 2, 12", "rewrite_utt_text": "What are the common ingredients used in base liquors and wines, and how do their flavors differ?", "response_utt_text": "Base liquors and wines vary significantly in their ingredients and flavors. Base liquors, such as vodka, gin, whiskey, tequila, and rum, are typically made through fermentation followed by distillation. Vodka is often made from grains or potatoes, gin from juniper berries and botanicals, whiskey from grains like barley or corn, tequila from the agave plant, and rum from sugarcane or molasses. Their flavors can range from neutral (vodka) to complex, with notes of spice, botanicals, or sweetness (like rum).  \n\nWines, on the other hand, are made primarily from fermented grapes. The type of grape and the fermentation process contribute to the wine's flavors, which can be fruity, floral, earthy, or even tannic, depending on factors like the grape variety and the region where it's grown. In general, base liquors tend to have a stronger, more concentrated flavor due to the distillation process, while wines offer a broader spectrum of flavors influenced by the grape and vinification techniques."}
