Atkins 20 limits the net carbs to 20 grams per day during the initial phase, which is designed for rapid weight loss, emphasizing protein and fat intake while minimizing carbohydrates severely. On the other hand, Atkins 40 is more flexible, allowing 40 grams of net carbs per day from the start, making it easier for some individuals to adhere to it while still promoting weight loss.

Distilled spirits, such as base liquors and liqueurs, undergo distillation, which involves heating fermented liquids to separate alcohol from water and impurities, resulting in a higher alcohol content. These spirits are typically stronger and used in cocktails or enjoyed neat.

In contrast, wines, which are fermented beverages, usually have a lower alcohol content, typically between 8% to 15% ABV, depending on the type.

For example, whiskey has a rich and smoky flavor from fermented grain mash, while gin is characterized by its botanical ingredients, especially juniper berries. On the other hand, wines are made from fermented grapes, and their flavors can range from sweet to dry, influenced by the grape variety, fermentation process, and aging method.

They typically contain lower alcohol content than base liquors, often ranging from 15% to 30%. While base liquors are generally strong and more straightforward in flavor, liqueurs are designed to be sweeter and more aromatic, making them popular in cocktails and desserts.
