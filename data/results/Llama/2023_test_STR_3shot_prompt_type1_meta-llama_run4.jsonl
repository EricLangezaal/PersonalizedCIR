It comprises fat, usually from the milk of cows, buffalo, goats, or sheep. On the other hand, vegan cheese is a non-dairy, plant-based product. Vegan cheese is 100 percent animal-free cheese and is made using vegetable proteins. The ingredients of vegan cheese include soy, nuts, cashews, and vegetable oils (such as coconut oil). Vegan cheese is made using a process similar to traditional cheese making-without the animal milk. During the process, the plant proteins are separated using bacteria. Then the ingredients, such as oils and thickeners, are added to achieve the desired cheese-like consistency.", "Based on the nutritional facts, mozzarella can be considered safe for lactose-intolerant people to eat, but be aware that the type of mozzarella you buy may not help reduce your symptoms. This is because many types of processed and packaged mozzarella also contain whey powder or casein - two other forms of dairy which are high in lactose. However, mozzarella has almost no lactose. Just one ounce of cheese provides around 0.3 grams of lactose. Vegan cheese is also a good alternative for lactose-intolerant people. Vegan cheeses are 100 percent animal-free and made using vegetable proteins. There are many different types of vegan cheese available, including vegan mozzarella. So, both mozzarella and vegan cheese can be suitable for lactose-intolerant people. It depends on your personal preference and dietary needs.", "Nutritional yeast has a nutty, cheesy flavor which makes it a popular cheese substitute among vegans and health-conscious eaters. You can buy nutritional yeast in most health food stores, larger supermarkets in the health/organic section, or online. It's often available in both flaked and powdered forms. Do you think this could be a good alternative for you?", "Sure, another alternative could be ricotta cheese. It's a bit milder than feta, but has less fat and calories.

Would one of these be a good fit for your needs?", "I am sorry, which cheese do you want me to compare?", "Sure, I can compare ricotta with cottage cheese for you. As you are interested in the nutritional value of the food, let me compare them on this bases. Both ricotta cheese and cottage cheese are high in vitamins, minerals, and nutrients. Ricotta is higher in calcium, zinc, fats, and cholesterol, while cottage cheese is higher in sugars and sodium. Some of this is caused by cottage cheese having a slightly higher water content. However, the nutrition of cottage cheese varies based on the milkfat percentage used. If you are looking to save some calories, it is worth considering substituting ricotta for cottage cheese where appropriate. However, cottage cheese is loaded with sodium compared to ricotta cheese. Ricotta cheese may be the better option if you are concerned about your daily sodium intake.", "If you are referring to your lactose intolerance, based on my sources, ricotta cheese, particularly fresh ricotta, contains less lactose than other dairy products because the enzymes used in the cheese-making process help digest some of the lactose before it enters the digestive system. However, the lactose content may vary depending on the specific brand or homemade recipe. Cottage cheese also contains lactose since it is made from milk, which is the primary source of lactose. The average lactose percentage in cottage cheese ranges from slightly over 2% to slightly over 3%, making it tolerable for many people with lactose sensitivity or intolerance. LACTAID offers a low-fat cottage cheese option that contains lactase, a natural enzyme that helps break down lactose and make it easier to digest for individuals with lactose intolerance. Dairy-free cottage cheese options are currently not available in the mainstream market.

Since you cannot make up time for a workout you might have stress because of work overload.", "There are some articles that suggest teaching is among the top three most stressed occupations. According to a study by the National Foundation for Educational Research, teachers are more likely to suffer job-related stress than other professionals. One in five teachers feels tense about their job all or most of the time, compared with one in eight workers in similar professions. Teacher stress is one of the main factors that has been pushing many out of the profession. Now do you want me to help you with controlling/reducing stress?", "Teachers confront disheartening experiences that can lead to fatigue, anxiety, and depression. Left unmanaged, these symptoms can result in teacher burnout. Some of the causes of teacher burnout include: 1) Poor Funding: Many districts and schools lack sufficient funding for updated materials, technology, and staff. This places a huge burden on teachers, who must make do with insufficient books and supplies while managing high teacher-to-student ratios. Over time, this burden can leave teachers feeling hopeless and ill-equipped to address achievement gaps and meet students' needs. 2) High Emotional Demands: In addition to educating students, teachers must care for students' emotional needs, which can be emotionally demanding. Teachers often feel the very future of a generation rests on their shoulders. If a work environment lacks the support needed to fulfill this responsibility, teachers can understandably feel overwhelmed. 3) Inadequate Preparation: Sometimes schools put teachers in situations they are not adequately prepared to handle. For example, administrators may require educators to teach outside of their subject area. Such scenarios not only prevent students from learning but also prevent teachers from feeling accomplished, which can cause burnout.", "There are many methods to reduce stress. You can try some light Yoga but if you can't make time for it, there are other methods as well. You can breathe deeply, laugh it off, chew gum, try self-hypnosis, and many more. Do you want me to explain them?", "Yes, chewing gum can provide a variety of health benefits. The American Dental Association now recommends chewing sugarless gum after eating because the increased saliva washes away plaque and bacteria that cause periodontal disease. Also, chewing gum after a meal can prevent heartburn symptoms in GERD patients by neutralizing acid fluids and helping to force them back into the stomach. Chewing gum speeds up peristalsis further down in the small intestine and has been used to treat postoperative ileus following colon surgery for diverticulitis or cancer. Other studies suggest that chewing gum can cause weight loss and improve concentration and memory.", "Do you mean weight loss by chewing gum?", "Yes, the findings from empirical studies and case reports indicate merit in the clinical use of self-hypnosis, and point to some features of self-hypnosis that appear important in positive treatment outcomes. There are successful outcomes involving self-hypnosis with adults or children. They have been reported for the treatment of anxiety (including test anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, simple phobia, and panic disorder), chronic pain (including psychogenic dysphonia, post-traumatic contractures of the hand, abdominal pain, and tension headaches), and habit disorders (including smoking, over-eating, alcoholism, and drug addiction) as well as in the management of mourning, hypertension, cancer, tinnitus, enuresis, insomnia, and depression."], "rewrite_utt_text": "1.

People with diabetes who choose to drink need to take extra care keeping food, medications, alcohol, and blood sugars in balance. Alcoholic beverages with a low amount of carbohydrates and sugar are suitable for diabetic patients, such as whiskey. But alcoholic beverages that contain moderate or high sugar levels can be hazardous for people with diabetes. Consumption of such drinks or beverages can increase or decrease glucose or sugar levels in your body. Popular drinks such as beer or wine are delightful in their taste and nature, and you should completely avoid such drinks. Final Verdict This article contains the answer to fundamental questions that whiskey lovers keep asking whether diabetics drink whiskey. Diabetics can have whiskey in low or moderate quantities as this drink does not contain fats or carbohydrates. Whiskey also has close to zero sugar, so you can enjoy this cold beverage on summer days.

And do histamine levels in foods change with cooking or processing methods?", "cur_response_text": "Histamine levels in foods can indeed change with cooking or processing methods. The level of histamines in a particular food can fluctuate depending on storage conditions, freshness, and preparation methods. For example, when some foods age, their histamine levels increase. Canned beans tend to have high histamine levels because they can spend a long time being preserved. On the other hand, dried beans do not age in the same way and have fewer histamines. Soaking and cooking dried beans further reduce their histamine levels. Boiling foods, including legumes, can help decrease histamine levels while frying and grilling can increase them. Quick cooking methods like pressure cooking can significantly reduce histamine levels. It's important to note that freezing can prevent histamine levels from increasing, but during the thawing process, histamine levels can rise. Therefore, consuming foods as fresh as possible and cooking them using quick and appropriate methods can help minimize histamine levels.", "ptkb": {"1": "I'm a couch potato.", "2": "I'm a Netflix addict.", "3": "I'm proud of my selfie with Bob Dylan.", "4": "I enjoy good food and wine.", "5": "I have a stressful job.", "6": "I've been thinking of checking out some interesting upcoming rock concerts.", "7": "I'm into rock music.", "8": "I am histamine intolerant.", "9": "I have diabetes.", "10": "I'm an avid swimmer.", "11": "I'm the CEO of a startup.", "12": "I live in the city."}, "ptkb_provenance": [], "response_provenance": ["clueweb22-en0039-99-10435:6", "clueweb22-en0039-99-10435:7", "clueweb22-en0039-99-10435:11", "clueweb22-en0039-99-10435:12"], "ctx_utts_text": ["What is histamine intolerance exactly?", "Okay, understood.

When there's too much histamine for DAO to handle, it can lead to symptoms like headaches, hives, irregular menstrual cycle, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and difficulty regulating body temperature.", "Histamine intolerance may impact your lifestyle in different ways. For swimming, the main concern is whether symptoms such as dizziness or nausea, which can occur with histamine intolerance, may impact your ability to swim safely. Regarding your diet, histamine intolerance might require some adjustments, as certain foods are high in histamines. This includes certain types of alcohol and various kinds of food such as matured cheeses, fermented foods, cured meats, and certain types of fish. You might need to reduce your intake of these types of food or avoid them altogether.", "Aged alcohols are high in histamine, and various types of liquor, as well as flavored or colored spirits, can also contain histamine. Additionally, packaged mixers like Grenadine and Margarita Mix can trigger mast cell degranulation and histamine release due to their ingredients. Here's a list of alcohols to avoid: Aged rum, Beer, Bourbon, Brandy, Flavored or colored spirits, Hard cider, Liqueurs, Scotch, Whiskey, and Wine.", "Histamine intolerance can contribute to the development of prediabetes and diabetes. Studies have shown elevated histamine levels in individuals with diabetes and lower levels of histamine-degrading DAO enzymes in diabetic rats. Histamine receptors, such as H1, H2, H3, and H4, have been found to influence blood sugar regulation and lipid metabolism, and targeting these receptors may be helpful in treating diabetes. Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), which is closely related to histamine intolerance, can also contribute to diabetes and its symptoms. Mast cells are implicated in metabolic diseases, inflammation, and immune system issues.", "I understand. Managing dietary restrictions for both diabetes and histamine intolerance can indeed be overwhelming. One effective way to keep track of this is by keeping a food diary. Note down what you eat and how you feel afterward. Over time, you'll start to notice patterns and get a better understanding of what foods work for you and what don't.", "Stress can trigger an increase in histamine release, exacerbating symptoms associated with histamine intolerance such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, and panic attacks. Histamine intolerance itself is caused by an imbalance between histamine release and the body's ability to metabolize it. Stress triggers the release of cortisol, which activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system, leading to the release of neurotransmitters and histamine. Histamine is also related to panic attacks, with histamine's role in vasodilation potentially causing symptoms associated with panic attacks. Therefore, managing and reducing stress levels can be beneficial in minimizing histamine intolerance symptoms. By identifying and effectively managing sources of stress, individuals with histamine intolerance may experience a reduction in symptoms.", "While being a CEO of a startup can be stressful, finding stress management techniques that work for you is crucial. Activities like mindfulness meditation, deep-breathing exercises, yoga, or even regular swimming can be helpful in managing stress. It's also important to ensure that you're getting sufficient sleep, as lack of sleep can increase histamine production.", "Mindfulness meditation is a practice that combines mindfulness and meditation. It involves being fully present and not overly reactive, bringing awareness to the information your senses are offering. The goal is to train attention and awareness, achieving a mentally clear and emotionally calm state. Mindfulness meditation has been practiced for centuries and offers numerous benefits, including lower stress levels, improved sleep, better overall health and relationships, increased productivity, and a sense of inner peace and stillness. There are many different forms and techniques of meditation, and it's important to find what works best for you. It's not about quieting the mind completely, but rather finding the quiet that is already there. A basic framework for mindful meditation often starts with a breathing technique, such as the 4-7-8 breath, to calm the mind and focus awareness. By practicing mindfulness meditation regularly, individuals can experience the transformative effects it can have on their mental, emotional, spiritual, and physical well-being.", "Mindfulness meditation and yoga are similar in that they both emphasize mindfulness and the present moment. However, they also have distinct differences. Yoga incorporates a physical aspect with asanas (poses) that are used to connect to the breath and the present moment. It is possible to practice meditation while doing yoga, as yoga can be seen as a moving meditation. On the other hand, meditation is generally practiced in stillness, with little movement, and focuses on redirecting thoughts, being calm, aware, and mindful in the present moment. Yoga is often practiced for its physical benefits, such as increased strength, flexibility, and toning of muscles, while meditation provides benefits like reducing stress, improving concentration, promoting calmness, and developing inner and outer awareness.", "Histamine intolerance is often treated by focusing on Diamine Oxidase (DAO) levels, which is an enzyme responsible for breaking down excess histamine in the body. DAO supplementation is a common treatment for histamine intolerance when DAO levels are low. However, DAO supplementation alone may not be enough, as it does not affect the levels of histamine produced in the body. Other approaches include avoiding high-histamine foods, repairing the gut microbiome, and moderating the immune system. Additional tools such as medical mushrooms like Agaricus blazei Murill (Royal Sun Agaricus) and Ganoderma lucidum (Reishi) may also be used to support the immune system and reduce inflammation-based symptoms of histamine intolerance.", "Antihistamines are commonly used to reduce symptoms such as itching, nasal congestion, red skin rashes, and other allergic reactions associated with histamine intolerance. They are available in various forms, both by prescription and over the counter. Antihistamines can be classified as sedating (first-generation) or non-sedating (second-generation). Sedating antihistamines may cause short-term effects such as urinary retention, constipation, dry mouth, increased appetite, and worsened narrow-angle glaucoma. However, most side effects are mild and stop when the medication is discontinued or the dosage is reduced. Non-sedating antihistamines are typically used for long-term control of allergies, and no serious side effects have been reported.", "Yes, there are several natural remedies and lifestyle changes that can help reduce histamine buildup in the body. Here are a few: (1) An anti-inflammatory diet like the Mediterranean Diet can be effective in reducing histamine levels. (2) Foods rich in polyphenols, such as watercress, can act as natural antihistamines and reduce histamine production. (3) Vitamin C supplements can be powerful antihistamines and help with histamine degradation. However, caution should be exercised with dosage and potential side effects. (4) Quercetin, found in foods like onions and garlic, and stinging nettle can work as a natural antihistamine. Combining quercetin, stinging nettle, and vitamin C can be effective. (6) Fiber-rich foods, particularly resistant starch, can help regulate mast cells and reduce histamine levels.", "The Mediterranean Diet can help with histamine intolerance due to the compounds naturally found in the foods that make up this diet. The diet includes fresh fruits and vegetables, fish, nuts and seeds, lean meats, whole grains, beans, and olive oil. These components provide various benefits that may help reduce allergy symptoms and eliminate the need for antihistamine medication. For example, the diet is rich in vitamin C, which can reduce inflammation and histamine levels. It also includes foods like red grapes, black tea, onions, and broccoli that contain compounds like resveratrol and quercetin, which have natural antihistamines and anti-inflammatory properties. Additionally, the Mediterranean Diet incorporates omega-3 fatty acids, which have anti-inflammatory effects and can help protect against allergic reactions. The diet is also high in folate, found in beans and lentils, which has been shown to suppress allergy symptoms by degrading histamine levels.
